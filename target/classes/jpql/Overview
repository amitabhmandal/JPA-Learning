The Java Persistence Query Language
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@



The Java Persistence query language defines queries for entities and their persistent state. 
The query language allows you to write portable queries that work regardless of the underlying 
data store.

The query language uses the abstract persistence schemas of entities, including their 
relationships, for its data model and defines operators and expressions based on this 
data model. The scope of a query spans the abstract schemas of related entities that are 
packaged in the same persistence unit. 

The query language uses an SQL-like syntax to select objects or values based on
 entity abstract schema types and relationships among them.
