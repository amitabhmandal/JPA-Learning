===================
Value Type Meanings:
====================

#1
No database identity: Does not contain @Id annotation

#2
Embedded with an Entity, hence they do not have any life cycle of their own

#3
3 sub-categories of value types: 
1. basic types - Like String, long etc
2. composite types - Like addresses etc which is part of some entity however they dont have their own
	@Id field
3. collection types - They represent a group of basic value types such as List<String> etc.
When it comes to collection types then they have different kinds of mapping for List<String> which 
represents basic value types and List<Entity> which is represented by different mapping.


Basic Value Type:
It is always mapped to a single database column value.
It is non aggregated Java type. By non-aggregated means it does not contain any other fields.
