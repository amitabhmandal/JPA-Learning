JP QL supports two types of parameter binding syntax. The first is 
======================
1. positional binding 
======================
where parameters are indicated in the query string by a question mark followed by the 
parameter number.
When the query is executed, the developer specifies the parameter number that should be 
replaced.

Positional Parameter Notation Example:
SELECT e
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.department = ?1 AND
e.salary > ?2

================
2. Named binding 
================
Named parameters may also be used and are indicated in the query string by a colon followed by
the parameter name.
When the query is executed, the developer specifies the parameter name that
should be replaced.

For example:
SELECT e
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.department = :dept AND
e.salary > :base
