It is an Object Relational Mapping

It implements the JPA specification.

JPA specification is part of Java EE platform. And it defines a specification of persisting data.

This is only a subset of specification.

There are other pieces of the framework that do not adhere to this specification.


The job of Hibernate is to make persisting data easier.
And the way we do that is by providing meta-data.
And that meta-data is to provide persitent operations automated and we no longer need to use JDBC and no longer manually need
to create SQL statements.

Another interesting option provided by hibernate is HQL (Hibernate Query Language).
It is similar to SQL however it allows to Query Objects that are created in the Object Oriented Design.

Technical Perspective How hibernate works:


The first thing we need in hibernate is
------------------ 
Configuration File
------------------
1. configuration file provided by Hibernate.cfg.xml file or hibernate properties.
This file is used to specify our connection information to the database along with other properties that instruct 
hibernate how to perform.

----------------------
Defining our Meta-Data
----------------------
2. How to map our entities with our relational database.
An entity is a plain old Java Object so we have a class fields and some getters and setters with those fields.
and normally those fields correspond to the columns in the database. 
And the class itself correspond the table in the database.

In the past XML files was used heavily for this purpose.
From Java 5.0 annotations are possible for configuring our POJO's

Once we have configuration file and how to define our meta-data has been decided we will look into other aspects.
-------
Session
-------
We use a session factory to get a session.

But why do we need a session?
The session factory holds all our configuration and our mapping meta-data and with this information  
We are then ready to create our session object

What is the importance of Session Object:
With the session object we can invoke persistence methods. And those methods are the ones we will perform CRUD operations
for each of the entities.

Benefits of Using Hibernate:
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

1. it removes the SQL from our code.
2. It automates the creation of SQL so that data persistence is performed for us instead of us writing the SQL manually for that 
operation.
3. It reduces our development time.
4. Reduces lines of code.
5. It makes our code more maintenable
6. Since it is following standards hence it becomes to transition over and start something from scratch.
7. It really abstracts the code from our RDBMS hence we can easily migrate database.
8. Lot of tutorial and help us with us any technical problem.

Hibernate Configuration
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Can be specified in 3 Manners
1. Properties File
2. XML File (Most Preferred)
3. Configuration through Java Code(This is most least used)
