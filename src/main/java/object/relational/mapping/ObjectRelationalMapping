Cross Cutting concerns:
Security
Validation 
Error Handling
Logging 
Data Persistence: Persistence refers to the characteristic of the state that outlives it. Without this capability
state would only exist in RAM and would be lost when the power to RAM is lost such as a computer shutdown.

When we are working with a web application then all the information is saved in secondary storage.

This information can be fetched in a later time.

Definition of ORM:
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
Hence ORM is a technique which uses Meta data to connect object oriented code to a relational database

******************
Why do we need ORM
******************
1. Reduces persistent code, development time and maintenance time
2. Bridges the gap between the data model and object model
3. Removes the SQL from the application logic supporting the DRY principle
4. Facilitates building of the persistent layer
5. Key management problem sorted out
6. Familar persistent implementation
7. open source well tested solution.
