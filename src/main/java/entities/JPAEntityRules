There are a few points to keep in mind when creating an entity class:

JPA allows persistent classes to inherit from non-persistent classes, persistent classes to 
inherit from other persistent classes, and non-persistent classes to inherit from persistent 
classes.

The entity class should have a default no-argument constructor.

The entity class should not be final.

Persistent classes cannot inherit from certain natively-implemented system classes such as 
java.net.Socket and java.lang.Thread.

If a persistent class inherits from a non-persistent class, the fields of the non-persistent 
super class cannot be persisted.
